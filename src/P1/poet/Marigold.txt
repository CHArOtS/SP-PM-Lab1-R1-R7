I dreamed a beautiful dream
you were there as well as I.
It doesn't seem like a dream
even it's over.
I miss you caress my hand as you watch me while I sleep.
Your melody still remains in this room and it rings:

Star-la lah-la lah
love you always deeply
genuinely, immensely,
steadily with all my heart.
Be strong and all will be alright.
You are the aria itself
shine out!

I remember you from dream
playing my favourite song for me.
Your melody becomes a part of my whole world.

Stel-la lah-la lah
love you too always deeply
geniunely,immensely,
steadily with all my heart.
I'll be strong and all will be fine.
I'll be strong and all will be fine.
