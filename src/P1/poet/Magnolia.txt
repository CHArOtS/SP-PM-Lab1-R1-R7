Your lie lies on frozen lips.
As pale petals bout to fall off.
Hopefully I'll get used to this
hoax that our love made.
Wind whines through broken tips.
As our memories die off.
Hopefully you'll get used to my
Hugs meaning goodbye.

Loves me,loves me not.
Tried to get a rise out of
magnolia petals but soon scattered them over you.
Watch me fall and drop away.

Dropped me bad...
Dropped me bad...

Full of tears shall be stream.
Life ends up Lacrimosa.
Shattered heart, burnt my life out.
Why you still my remedy.

Loves me,loves me not.
Tried to get a rise out of
magnolia petals but soon scattered them over you.
Watch me fall and drop away.
Hear me cry.
Our love's dead dried.
